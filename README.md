<strong><i>A simple Hijri widget to keep track of the Hijri date on your homescreen. Uses sighting data from <a href="https://github.com/AbdullahM0hamed/HilalMonths">here</a> instead of pre-calculated estimations like the Ummul-Qura calendar.</i></strong>
</div>

# Features

1: Display Hijri Date as well as the gregorian date

2: Display Gregorian Day/Hijri Day of the week between sunset and midnight (currently sunset is assumed to be 6, but should be calculated for better accuracy)

3: Display time

4: Settings to change which group sighting data is collected from (so that you can use sighting data based on your region)

5: Ability to modify widget text colour

2: Calculate sunset
